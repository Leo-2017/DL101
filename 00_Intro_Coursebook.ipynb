If any organization is interested in doing something in practice with a model, then presumably they have some inputs they plan to run their model against. And presumably they've been doing that some other way for a while (e.g., manually, or with some heuristic program), so they have data from those processes! For instance, a radiology practice will almost certainly have an archive of medical scans (since they need to be able to check how their patients are progressing over time), but those scans may not have structured labels containing a list of diagnoses or interventions (since radiologists generally create free-text natural language reports, not structured data). We'll be discussing labeling approaches a lot in this book, because it's such an important issue in practice.\n","\n","Since these kinds of machine learning models can only make *predictions* (i.e., attempt to replicate labels), this can result in a significant gap between organizational goals and model capabilities. For instance, in this book you'll learn how to create a *recommendation system* that can predict what products a user might purchase. This is often used in e-commerce, such as to customize products shown on a home page by showing the highest-ranked items. But such a model is generally created by looking at a user and their buying history (*inputs*) and what they went on to buy or look at (*labels*), which means that the model is likely to tell you about products the user already has or already knows about, rather than new products that they are most likely to be interested in hearing about. That's very different to what, say, an expert at your local bookseller might do, where they ask questions to figure out your taste, and then tell you about authors or series that you've never heard of before."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7aHWdIBuefhk"},"source":["Another critical insight comes from considering how a model interacts with its environment. This can create *feedback loops*, as described here:\n","\n","- A *predictive policing* model is created based on where arrests have been made in the past. In practice, this is not actually predicting crime, but rather predicting arrests, and is therefore partially simply reflecting biases in existing policing processes.\n","- Law enforcement officers then might use that model to decide where to focus their police activity, resulting in increased arrests in those areas.\n","- Data on these additional arrests would then be fed back in to retrain future versions of the model.\n","\n","This is a *positive feedback loop*, where the more the model is used, the more biased the data becomes, making the model even more biased, and so forth.\n","\n","Feedback loops can also create problems in commercial settings. For instance, a video recommendation system might be biased toward recommending content consumed by the biggest watchers of video (e.g., conspiracy theorists and extremists tend to watch more online video content than the average), resulting in those users increasing their video consumption, resulting in more of those kinds of videos being recommended. We'll consider this topic more in detail in <<chapter_ethics>>."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CUoMooiSJoIH"},"source":["### Machine Learning

Machine Learning Workflow to all our ML applications. It is integral to any machine learning model.\n","\n","1. *Translate a Business Goal to Machine Learning task:* Define your objective, dataset, the model you intend to build and the metrics you want to measure. It is important to do your research to see if labeled data already exists, where it comes from to define how you should define it for your model. What is your input and output?\n","\n","2. *Collect and construct your dataset:* This is the most time-intensive effort of the job of a machine learning engineer. After having defined your dataset you have to start (1) collecting it, (2) identify feature and label sources, (3) select a sampling strategy, and (4) split the data into different sets.\n","\n","3. *Data Transformation:* Data Transformation is absolutely necessary for data compatibility. The data that is collected and constructed has to be transformed in order for the model to be able to process it. Apart of converting data types, resizing inputs to a fixed size, and other transformations you also have to explore and clean your data (i.e. examine rows of data, fix entries etc.).\n","\n","4. *Train your model:* Training means creating or learning the model. That is, you show the model labeled examples and enable the model to gradually learn the relationships between features and labels. You will realise that this process is automatic and you will have to closely pay attention to the key metrics you defined in step 1.\n","\n","5. *Interpret the model and make predictions:* Once the model is successfully trained you will be able to interpret its performance using various visualization and interpretation methods. Machine learning inference means to apply the trained model to unlabeled examples it has never seen before and make actual predictions on the data.\n","\n","Some of the steps might seem confusing and not entirely clear.
